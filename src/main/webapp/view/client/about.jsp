                Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal
                to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the
                popular online casino networks such as Party
                Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being
                chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a
                solution and new online casinos
                started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that,
                rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic
                banking systems that would accept
                this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic
                banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online casinos.
